# MK-Img2fig
A plugin for markdown that turns standalone images into figures.

# Why?
I’ve been using [figAltCaption](https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption “Extension for Python Markdown to add captions to images”) for years but it currently has a problem with the latest version of Python Markdown.

I’m using this as a chance to explore creating a package without destroying what someone else might be relying on.
